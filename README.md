// How does this thing works?:

upload your geocache that should be released for adoption via the forum in the “Upload” tab or 
search for caches released for adoption under the tab “view all geocaches”

// How to use it:

Explore a nearby geocache that appeals to you. Copy the provided code
and visit the website mentioned in the description. Input the code into the designated field and submit
an adoption request. Following this, the owner of the cache will receive a notification to approve your inquiry. Once all steps are completed,
you should find the geocache listed as owned on your Geocaching.com profile.
